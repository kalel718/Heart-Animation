# 💖 Heart Animation - Mouse Trail Effect

> A magical heart trail that follows your mouse cursor! Move your mouse around and watch beautiful hearts float upward with a dreamy fade effect.

## ✨ What It Does

This project creates an enchanting visual effect where hearts appear wherever you move your mouse. Each heart:
- 🎯 Spawns exactly where your cursor is
- 📏 Has a random size for natural variety  
- 🎈 Floats upward with a smooth animation
- 👻 Fades away gracefully after 2 seconds
- 🖤 Looks stunning against the dark background

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone or download** this repository
2. **Open** `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. **Move your mouse** around the screen
4. **Enjoy** the heart trail magic! ✨

No installation, no dependencies, no fuss – just pure CSS and vanilla JavaScript goodness!

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
